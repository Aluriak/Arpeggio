Some stuff that should be done in the near future:
- Documentation.
- Test suite.
- Error recovery.
    This is the essential requirement for the Arpeggio because IDE usage is the main
    motivation that has started Arpeggio development.
    It would be nice to find all errors, whether syntactic or semantic, in one
    parsing session. If error is found the parser should report the error and then
    try to recover and continue parsing.
